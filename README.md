# yahoo-finance-api

## Motivation

- I used to write Python programs and use Yahoo Finance data. The [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) library is an awesome library which I enjoyed a lot.
- Could not find similar packages in Go.
- Learn Go
- Able to use this package on my other Go projects
